  "description": "One day, I opened my eyes and found myself in... prison?!\n That's right. Out of all the characters I could've reincarnated into, I woke up inside a R19 romance novel as the villain's younger sister. To make things even worse, I was locked up inside the infamous Kambrakam Prison for my brother's crimes. \n Deep within the very same prison lies Heinrich Dorian von Hel, who's rumoured to be suffering from a curse that turns him into a beast. In the original novel, he's supposed to meet the female lead and spend an... interesting night with her here in prison... but of course, the plot goes awry because of me. \n What's going to happen to me now that I've gotten myself tangled up between the novel's greatest villain and its male lead?!",
